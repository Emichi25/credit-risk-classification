# Credit-Risk-Classification

I used my notes and lecture videos from Modules 20.1-21.2 to complete this assignment. 


Credit Risk Analysis Report:

 1.) Explain the purpose of this analysis:

The point of this assignment was to design and evaluate the accuracy of a data model which reflects the credit worthiness of potential borrowers from lenders. 

2.) Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.2%. The sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the balanced prediction accuracy was 95.2%

Precision Score: 92%. This means 92% of predicted positives were correct

Recall Score: 95%. The model was 95% accurate in measuring true positive values in all positive predictions that were made

3.) Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

I would recommend that the company use this model to determine the credit worthiness of potential borrowers, because the model was able to be over 95% accurate in determining the likelihood of repayment on loans. This model could easily be adopted by the company’s risk division to predict which potential borrowers they could do business with and those they should not do business with at this time.
